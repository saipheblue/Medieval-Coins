Ever wanted to be able to craft your own coins? Are you fan of Medieval Overhaul mod? Say no more !

New ores:
Tin and copper - both can be mined in mine shaft


New furnace recipes:
Tin and copper ingots


New research:
Alchemy nodes for unlocking tin and copper in the same way you need to unlock steel.

New research branch:
Coinage for pure coins, coinage advanced for mixing ingots and coinage mastery allowing you to create 60% pure coins for max profit.



New items:
Gold coin - beauty 7, gives royal favor when traded with empire.
1 coin = 0.0004 favor. One gold = 0.015 favor. From 5 golds you have 50 coins. Coins compared to gold ingot are slightly better 0.02 vs 0.015 )

Silver coin - beauty 7, gives royal favor when traded with empire.
For 1000 silver coins you will get 0.015 favor. Same amount as for one gold ingot, to keep it as a nice feature but not making the game too easy.


New crafting bench:
Coining mill, based on a historical template


Recipes for coining mill:
5 silver or 1 tin + 4 silver ( need advanced research ) or 2 tin + 3 silver ( need master research ) for for 50 silver coins
5 gold or 1 copper + 4 gold ( need advanced research ) or 2 copper + 3 gold ( need master research ) for for 50 gold coins

New furniture:
Tin and copper barrel under storage tab

Math:

1 gold ingot = 10$
1 gold ingot = 10 coins
1 gold coin = 1$

1 silver ingot = 1$
1 silver ingot = 10 coins
1 silver coin = 0.1$

By mixing it with copper / tin you can get rich and it is historicaly accurate. ( Source was college papers about medieval coins )

Revert for ore yield changes made in "Medieval Overhaul Misc. Patches" mod related to MO. ( The rest of the patch operations were left unchanged )
If you want to keep the changes make sure the mod is loaded after mine.

Textures used from silver coins and gold coins mods, new ingots and barrels are reused textures from Medieval Overhaul, please give SirLalaPyon thumbs up his mod is INCREDIBLE and motivated me to create this one.

This is my first "regular" mod, please be patient with me. I am not native speaker so if you find something gramaticaly incorrect let me know and I will fix it.
I am not an artist and Coining mill texture is truly terrific, if you want to create better art please do it !

I will probably change the art of bench myself in the future. Recommend to place it as on pictures, east and west sides are ... not so good.

Compatibility issues:

Obviously not compatible with Gold coins, Silver coins and Medieval Overhaul + Gold Coins Compatibility Patch
